## evaluation.jpynb

# install requirements
Install all the libraries in the requirements.txt file

pip install -r requirements.txt

For information on how the file works, see the text blocks in evaluation.jpynb.
By default the evaluation.jpynb file uses small images. Uncomment the corresponding sections to use medium or large images (see the text block in the jupyter notebook)

The Github repository contains everything except the Data_images and Segmentation
Download the content of Data_images and Segmentation from the Google Drive


## Groundtruth_generation.py
If you want to use the groundtruth_generation.py file, the libraries from evaluation.jpynb are enough.
The evaluation.jpynb file runs without the Groundtruth_generation.py file.
